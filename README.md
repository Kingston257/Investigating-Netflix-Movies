**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex one's exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend, Tom has also been brushing up on his Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. He believes that the average duration of movies has been declining. Using our friend's initial research, I'll delve into the Netflix data to determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any.

## The data
The dataset `netflix_data.csv`. The following table details the column names and descriptions:

### **netflix_data.csv**
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `show_id` | The ID of the show |
| `type` | Type of show |
| `title` | Title of the show |
